# [bindless_render]

Demonstrates how to fetch shaders, bind-table layouts, geometry, and imagery from the bundled
database and render with a bindless descriptor table. The example builds the bind table using the
`shader/bind_table` layout parsed from the database, uploads two sample textures, and draws the
quad geometry using the corresponding pipeline.
