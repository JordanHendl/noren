# [Examples]

Examples of using 'noren' to render visual data (through dashi).

Each example writes its output to `target/example_outputs/<example-name>/`. See
the README inside each example directory for details on the generated artifact
and how to validate it.

For these examples, they all reference the sample database in the root source
directory ('{root}/samples/db'). See the README.md there to see how it is
generated.
