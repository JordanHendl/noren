# [model_render]

Fetches a model from the database, uploads its resources, and produces a
headless preview. Running `cargo run --example model_render` creates:

* `target/example_outputs/model_render/model.txt` – text summary of the loaded
  meshes and materials.
* `target/example_outputs/model_render/preview.png` – a textured render of the
  quad model.

Review both artifacts to verify the demo.
