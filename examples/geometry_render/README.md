# [geometry_render]

Loads untextured geometry from the database and produces a headless render of
the mesh. The preview image is written to
`target/example_outputs/geometry_render/preview.png`.

After running the example with
`cargo run --example geometry_render`, open the generated PNG to confirm that a
filled quad is produced.
